# Viro Media App

This is the main sample project that we'll submit to the app store and show off our example Viro applications.

## Build instructions

From the root of this project, you should run `npm install`. It will probably fail because react-viro was removed from the public npm registry. To make it work, follow the instructions [here](http://podefr.tumblr.com/post/30488475488/locally-test-your-npm-modules-without-publishing) to test the react-viro module locally.

From the ViroMediaApp (iOS) directory, you need to run `pod install`.

From the ViroMediaApp (iOS) directory, open the xcode workspace (ViroMediaApp.xcworkspace).
